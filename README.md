# Connect_4_with_Min_Max_Algorithm_AI

Connect 4 is a two-player game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns
dropping their colored discs from the top into a grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying
the next available space within the column. The objective of the game is to connect-four of
oneâ€™s own discs of the same color next to each other vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. The
two players keep playing until the board is full. The winner is the player having greater
number of connected-fours.
